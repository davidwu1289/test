Subject: Urgent Personal Leave Request Due to Family Emergency
Hi Pavan / Assad,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of an unforeseen and urgent situation that requires my immediate attention. Due to a critical family emergency, I must travel to India at the earliest. I have managed to secure a flight within the next hour and plan to be away for approximately two weeks.
This situation was completely unexpected, and I understand the challenges my absence may cause to our ongoing projects. Please be assured that I have taken steps to ensure minimal disruption:
* 		Task Delegation: Pandit is aware of all the code and is well-equipped to handle my responsibilities in my absence.
* 		Availability for Emergencies: While I intend to be with my family during this period, I will remain available for any critical issues. You can reach me at my mobile number: +1-951-456-7643.
I understand the importance of our current projects and deeply regret the inconvenience my sudden departure may cause. I request your understanding and support during this challenging time. I will do my best to stay in touch and provide any assistance remotely.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to returning and resuming work as soon as possible.
Warm regards,
Rishika
