Data Processing Tool - Design and Implementation
Introduction
The Data Processing Tool is a Java-based utility designed to validate and process data records stored in a length-delimited file. It reads data from the input file, applies various validation rules based on a predefined schema, and generates output files with validated records. The tool provides options to split the output into multiple files based on the number of lines or the data size.

Design Overview
The Data Processing Tool is implemented in Java and follows an object-oriented design. The primary classes in the tool are:

DataProcessor: This class is responsible for reading and validating the data from the input file, applying the validation rules based on the schema, and generating the output files. It also handles splitting the output files based on the specified criteria.

FieldInfo: This class represents the metadata for each field in the schema. It stores the field name, data type, and length, which are used during data validation.

Record: This is an inner class within DataProcessor that represents the data structure for a single record. It uses a Map to store field values, where the field name is the key and the field value is the value.

SampleDataGenerator: This class generates sample data records based on the schema to aid in testing and development.

Schema Definition
The schema is defined as a list of FieldInfo objects, where each FieldInfo object represents a field in the data file. The FieldInfo class contains properties to store the field name, data type, and length. The data type can be one of the following: "Numeric," "String," "Date," or "Timestamp." The length defines the number of characters the field should have.

Data Validation
The data validation process is performed by the DataProcessor class. For each record in the input file, the DataProcessor creates a Record object to store the field values. It then iterates through the schema and applies validation rules for each field based on its data type.

Validation Rules
The following validation rules are applied:

Field Position Validation: The tool checks that each field starts at the correct position in the record.

Data Consistency Validation: This validation is specific to business rules or logic. For example, a date in one field should not be later than a date in another field, or a specific numeric field should always be greater than zero.

Duplicate Record Validation: The tool checks for any duplicate records in the dataset.

Data Range Validation: Certain fields might have constraints on the range of values they can have.

Record Count Validation: The number of records in the data file should match the count mentioned in the control file.

Record Length Validation: The total length of each record should be 330 characters.

Field Length Validation: Each field in the record should match the length specified in the schema.

Data Type Validation: Numeric fields should only contain numeric characters and possibly leading zeros. String fields should not contain any unexpected special characters. Date and timestamp fields should follow the specified format.

Padding Validation: Numeric fields should be right-justified and padded with zeros. String fields should be left-justified and padded with spaces.

Null Value Validation: The tool checks for null values in specific fields that should always have a value.

Data Splitting
The tool provides the flexibility to split the validated data into multiple output files. This is useful for handling large datasets. The user can specify the number of lines per file or the data size per file. The data splitting logic is implemented in the splitDataIntoOutputFiles method of the DataProcessor class.

Sample Data Generation
The SampleDataGenerator class generates sample data records based on the schema. It uses random number generation and string manipulation to create data with the specified field lengths and formats.

Usage
To use the Data Processing Tool, follow these steps:

Create a schema by defining the FieldInfo objects and add them to the schema list in the DataProcessor class.

Prepare the input data file in the specified length-delimited format.

Optionally, create a control file with the desired record count for validation.

Instantiate the DataProcessor class, passing the input data file, output directory, and control file path if available.

Call the processData method to start the data validation and processing.

The tool will apply the validation rules and generate output files with valid records.

Conclusion
The Data Processing Tool provides a reliable and flexible solution for validating and processing large datasets stored in length-delimited files. It offers various data validation rules, data splitting options, and sample data generation for easy testing. The tool can be used in various data processing scenarios to ensure data quality and integrity.
